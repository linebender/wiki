# Linebender graphics wiki

{% hint style="info" %}
This wiki is now **archived**. You should instead visit the [Linebender wiki](https://linebender.org/wiki/) at <https://linebender.org/wiki>
{% endhint %}

Right now this is just an experiment to see if gitbook wiki structure will work well for 2D graphics related knowledge. The Linebender project has a lot of graphics-related subprojects, encompassing curves, text layout, and and experimental GPU-based renderer.
